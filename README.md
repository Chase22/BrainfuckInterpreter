## How to become part of it
This Repository works like everything else. Take a language that isn't already finished, program the interpreter, put it into a seperate Directory, Labled as the Name of the Language and make a Pull Request.

## What every Interpreter must be able to do
Every interpreter must be able to parse a file containing brainfuck source code and execute it.
A Reference is this specification https://github.com/brain-lang/brainfuck/blob/master/brainfuck.md
It is up to you how the interpreter will execute the `.` and `,` command
